# At the beginning of RUN
I have been having such thought since last year, when the working style was toxic: I had bare sleep, and felt depression about the future. I questioned about the meaning of living, and physical problems also occured to me. I was not interested in changing the surroundings either. 

I tried to escape, however, as the depression spreads across the country, my minimum skillset seemed obsoleted compared with those who worked for 3 or 5 years. There was no work around for me, especially when I had to work for 12 plus hours a day back then. 

I stared to question about the hard work I put into: if that was the return of the decades of education, I would rather not have one in the first place. 

My fiance, with whom I'll get married in a couple of weeks, has been very supportive. I started to realised, doing the best to please the boss was not even closed to realistic. I should stop being so responsible that the boss can easily take advantage from.

By the way, I'd like to introduce the boss, who does not even treat himself as human: he would be on a business trip from the morning, getting back at 6pm, and continue working till morning. As there's a clock-in requirement at 8:30, he would continue to work till clock-off. He wants me to be as "persevere" as him. Hope he'll get what he wants.

Enough talk. I'll dive into what I'll do.

I'll go to Singapore.
